# WarCraft-MineCraft
WarCraft:Minecraft is the attempt to recreate something like WarCraft:Source / WarCraft:GO in Minecraft

All races are completely made up by the races.conf that defines the skills, perks and everything else.

Take a look at the example race to see how it works (a better description will follow at some point).
