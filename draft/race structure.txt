Skill description:
These are strings that, space delimited, are used to call effect methods using reflection
For this the general syntax is 

Skill: Trigger (Condition...) EffectName Params...[ | EffectName Params...[...]]

Trigger: 
  "Active" make this skill active, meaning the player has to use ability 1-3 or ultimate to trigger this
  "OnSneak" is player is sneaking
  "OnJump" player is jumping
  "OnAttack" player is attacking entity
  "OnHit" player was hit
  "OnBlock"
  "OnUnblock"
  "OnUseItem" use condition to further filter
  "OnSprint"
  "OnDrop" use condition to further filter
  "OnPickup" use condition to further filter
  "OnSpawn"
  "OnDeath"
  
Condition: Object Comperator Value[ <&|/> Object Comperator Value[...]]
  Conditions are validating without order from left to right, you can however group them with round brackets 

  Object: 
    "source" the player himself
    "target" the victim, can be player or living entity or block
    "item" if a item is involved this is the item
    "damage" action damage if any
    "random" if you want a certain chance to trigger this, use above and below, values will be 0.0 .. 100.0
    for source and target also .hp, .mana and .xp - I refer to the hungerbar as mana... seems fitting
  
  Comperator:
    "Above"
    "Below"
    "teammate" - is in the same team as Value specifies
    "opponent" - is not in the team specified my Value
    "ofType" - calls getType on Value, EntityType for target, ItemType for item
    "notType" - oposite of ofType
  
  Value:
    Can be numeric (for hp, mana, xp), "damage", "target", "item", String (for types), $n to get a value from gaaoParameterMap[piAbilityLevel][n]
    
EffectName:
  Name of a method in the effect class, this method will be called using reflection

Params:
  List of parameters for the Effect
  Can be numeric (for hp, mana, xp), "damage", "source", "target", "item", String (for types), $n to get a value from gaaoParameterMap[piAbilityLevel][n]
  Valid numerics are also source.hp, source.mana, target.hp, target.mana
  A valid parameter value can also be a mathematic formula as long as all values (including gaaoParameterMap) are numeric 
  The ammount of params is determed by the effect method and can not varry.
